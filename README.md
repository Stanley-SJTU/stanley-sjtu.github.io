# stanley-sjtu.github.io/indexpage.html

This project aims to build a web page for sophology pratices. The resources of sophology are provided by the experts in Saint Etienne.  
The pages are static, so they are hosted on GitHub pages. Inside the pages, I have used W3.CSS to organise different elements, so that 
they will be mobile friendly.  
  
This project is still under development.
